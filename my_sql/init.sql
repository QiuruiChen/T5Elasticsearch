But China itself has come under heavy criticism in recent weeks for its treatment of Africans in the country. \n \nLast month, many Africans were subject to forced coronavirus testing and arbitrary 14-day self-quarantine in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, regardless of their recent travel history, and scores were left homeless after being evicted by landlords and rejected by hotels under the guise of various virus containment measures. \n \n The incident caused a rupture in China-Africa relations, with the foreign ministries of several African nations -- and even the African Union -- demanding answers from China. \n Yet China\'s official response stopped short of admitting that discrimination took place or apologizing for it.\n China has also faced criticism over its treatment of the predominantly Muslim Uyghur minority in Xinjiang.

Facebook said it had also taken down accounts linked to the far-right group Proud Boys, though it said it had not seen posts from that group discussing weaponry. The company said it had been planning on taking action against both groups, but had expedited the process when they saw how the groups were discussing the protests.

  ('Steve King loses primary after racist comments','2020-05-29','(CNN)Nine-term Congressman Steve King of Iowa will lose his Republican primary race to state Sen. Randy Feenstra on Tuesday, CNN projected, after King\'s racist comments led to his ostracization in Washington and Feenstra mobilized conservative Republicans to his insurgent campaign. \n "I called Randy Feenstra a little bit ago and conceded the race to him," King said in a video posted to Facebook early Wednesday morning. "And I pointed out that there\'s some powerful elements in the swamp that he\'s going to have an awfully hard time pushing back against them." \n The primary fight was an undeniable referendum on King -- not on his conservatism, but on his effectiveness in office. His lack of power, far more than his specific words and history of remarks on race, became a central issue in this year\'s race, with opponents arguing that he is unable to represent their views in the House or to the administration. \n King, an anti-immigration hardliner, had a well-documented history of controversial statements during his nine terms in office. But only after a New York Times interview in January 2019, in which the congressman questioned how "white nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization" became offensive, did House Republican leaders rebuke him by stripping him of his committee assignments. Last June, the Trump administration barred him from Air Force One when the President visited his state.\n King has said that his words have been mischaracterized and taken out of context, blaming the media and Republican leaders for leading a vendetta against him.\n "The Never Trumpers are the people who ginned this all up," King said in a recent debate, speaking with an air of defiance about the Republicans "who want Steve King out of the way."In his concession speech, King said those forces pushed him out of office. "This comes from an effort to push out the strongest voice for full spectrum, constitutional Christian conservatism that exists in the United States Congress," King said. Feenstra was viewed as King\'s toughest opponent in a five-way race that included former state legislator Jeremy Taylor, businessmen Steve Reeder and Army veteran Bret Richards. "I am truly humbled by the outpouring of support over the past 17 months that made tonight possible and I thank Congressman King for his decades of public service," Feenstra said in a statement. "As we turn to the General Election, I will remain focused on my plans to deliver results for the families, farmers and communities of Iowa. But first, we must make sure this seat doesn\'t land in the hands of Nancy Pelosi and her liberal allies in Congress. Tomorrow, we get back to work." Feenstra had won marquee endorsements and financial support from conservative groups in Washington, including the Chamber of Commerce and the National Right to Life Committee. He told voters he wanted a seat on the House Agriculture Committee -- something King no longer has. And he boasted a much greater campaign war chest, reporting over $415,000 on hand at the end of March compared to fewer than $30,000 for King. "The 4th District needs a seat at the table -- an effective conservative voice," Feenstra said in a recent debate. "Our district, our President, deserve an effective conservative leader in Congress." The biggest uncertainty heading into Tuesday, according to Republicans strategists in Iowa, was the number of absentee ballots. For the first time, all Iowa voters were sent request forms for mail-in ballots and as of Tuesday, over 70,000 Republican ballots had been requested in the district, with nearly 60,000 already returned, according to the office of Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate. Two years ago, fewer than 3,000 absentee ballots were recorded. The dramatic uptick in absentee ballots appeared to help doom the longtime congressman by bringing in new Republican voters. Bob Vander Plaats, a former King supporter and an influential Christian conservative, endorsed Feenstra, worried that if King wins the primary that Democrats would have a better shot to not only win his deep red district in northwest Iowa but also defeat President Donald Trump and Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst. Democrat J.D. Scholten, a former professional baseball player, came within three points of beating King in 2018 and is running again. Last week, Vander Plaats told CNN there had been a "growing fatigue" with King in the 4th District and a "gradual clarity" that "his voice is no longer desired at the table." King responded that Vander Plaats and Feenstra are sacrificing their principles "in their misguided effort to shut down real conservatives and hand this district over to RINOs and NeverTrumpers."

  ('Scientists say they have found the cleanest air on Earth','2020-05-28','Scientists believe they have identified the world\'s cleanest air, free from particles caused by human activity, located over the Southern Ocean, which surrounds Antarctica.\n In a first-of-its-kind study of the bioaerosol composition of the Southern Ocean, researchers from Colorado State University identified an atmospheric region which remains unchanged by human activity.\n Aerosol filter samplers probe the air over the Southern Ocean on the Australian Marine National Facility&#39;s R/V Investigator.\n Aerosol filter samplers probe the air over the Southern Ocean on the Australian Marine National Facility\'s R/V Investigator. Weather and climate are closely linked, connecting each part of the world with other regions. As the climate changes rapidly because of human activity, scientists and researchers struggle to find a corner of the Earth unaffected by people. However, professor Sonia Kreidenweis and her team suspected that the air over the Southern Ocean would be least affected by humans and dust from the world\'s continents. Researchers found that the boundary layer air, which feeds the lower clouds over the Southern Ocean, was free from aerosol particles produced by human activity -- including burning fossil fuels, planting certain crops, fertilizer production, and wastewater disposal -- or transported from other countries around the world. Air pollution is caused by aerosols, which are solid and liquid particles and gases that are suspended in the air.\n Researchers decided to study what was in the air, and where it came from, using bacteria in the air as a diagnostic tool to infer the properties of the lower atmosphere. \n Research scientist and co-author of the study Thomas Hill explained that "the aerosols controlling the properties of SO (Southern Ocean) clouds are strongly linked to ocean biological processes, and that Antarctica appears to be isolated from southward dispersal of microorganisms and nutrient deposition from southern continents," he said in a statement.\n "Overall, it suggests that the SO is one of very few places on Earth that has been minimally affected by anthropogenic activities," he added.\n Scientists sampled the air in the marine boundary level -- the part of the atmosphere that has direct contact with the ocean -- while aboard a research boat traveling south to the Antarctic ice edge from Tasmania, Australia. Scientists then examined the composition of airborne microbes, which are found in the atmosphere and often dispersed thousands of kilometers by the wind.\n Using DNA sequencing, source tracking and wind back trajectories scientist and first author Jun Uetake found that the microbes\' origins were from the ocean.\n From the bacterial composition of the microbes, researchers concluded that aerosols from distant land masses and human activities, such as pollution or soil emissions caused by land use change, were not traveling south and into the air.\n Scientists say that the results show a stark difference to all other studies from oceans both in the northern hemisphere and subtropics, which found that most microbes came from upwind continents.\n In the study, published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal, scientists described the area as "truly pristine." Air pollution is already a global public health crisis, and kills seven million people each year, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Studies have shown that air pollution increases the risk of heart disease, stroke and lung cancer. More than 80% of people living in urban areas that monitor air pollution are exposed to air quality levels that exceed WHO guideline limits, the health organization said, and low- and middle-income countries suffer from the highest exposures. However, as studies have shown, air pollution can cross geographical boundaries, and affect people hundreds of miles away from where it originated.'),

More than anybody else at this point, I need China," Duterte said before flying to China in April 2018. Compared with his predecessors, Duterte has viewed the Philippines\' ongoing territorial dispute over the South China Sea as more negotiable. Both the Philippines and China are among among several nations with overlapping claims to the sea, or parts of it. China claims almost all of the South China Sea\'s 1.3 million square miles as its own despite other claimants having borders that are far closer to the disputed waters. Last year, Duterte said he had been offered a controlling stake in a joint energy deal by Chinese President Xi Jinping in exchange for ignoring an international arbitration in Manila\'s favor on the South China Sea. In 2016, a tribunal in The Hague ruled in favor of the Philippines in a maritime dispute, concluding China has no legal basis to claim historic rights to the bulk of the South China Sea.

  ('\'I don\'t see racism at all in the NFL,\' Denver Broncos head coach says','2020-05-24','(CNN)Denver Broncos head coach Vic Fangio told reporters Tuesday he doesn\'t believe racism and discrimination are issues in the NFL. "I think our problems in the NFL along those lines are minimal," Fangio said. "We\'re a league of meritocracy, you earn what you get, you get what you earn." "I don\'t see racism at all in the NFL. I don\'t see discrimination in the NFL," Fangio added. "... We\'re lucky. We all live together, joined as one, for one common goal, and we all intermingle and mix tremendously. If society reflected an NFL team, we\'d all be great." Fangio\'s comments came as demonstrators reached their eighth day of protests over the death of George Floyd in police custody. Fangio called Floyd\'s death a "societal issue that we all have to join in to correct." Of the 32 teams in the NFL, just four have a nonwhite head coach. Of the five head coaching vacancies in the offseason, just one was filled by a nonwhite person when Ron Rivera, who is Hispanic, was hired by Washington.

Demonstrators at Linn Park took aim at the Confederate Soldiers & Sailors Monument, dedicated in 1905, on Sunday during a protest over systemic racism and police brutality in the aftermath of George Floyd\'s death. As some attempted to tear down the 52-foot-tall obelisk, Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin arrived at the scene. He pleaded with demonstrators to disperse before police came to make arrests, saying that he understood their anger and would have the monument removed.

Cities extend curfews for another night in an attempt to avoid violent protests over George Floyd\'s death The park is home to memorials including the veterans monument and a statue of Confederate sailor Charles Linn, installed in 2013. The former has been the subject of a lengthy legal battle between the city of Birmingham and the state of Alabama. The demonstration began as peaceful rally in downtown Birmingham, eventually moving to Linn Park after comedian Jermaine "FunnyMaine" Johnson suggested during a speech earlier that day that protesters meet him there. Protesters in the park toppled the statue of Linn and spray-painted and chiseled the base of the obelisk monument, according to AL.com.

  ('Mark Zuckerberg tries to explain his inaction on Trump posts to outraged staff','2020-04-30','(CNN Business)Facebook (FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg sought on Tuesday to ease employee outrage over his inaction on incendiary remarks recently posted by President Donald Trump. During a company-wide town hall, Zuckerberg struggled to explain his decision-making process as many of his employees, using a real-time feedback tool, reminded him of promises to remove content that calls for violence or that could lead to imminent physical harm. "It\'s crystal clear today that leadership refuses to stand with us," Brandon Dail, an engineer at Facebook, tweeted as the town hall was taking place. Facebook spokesman Andy Stone said in a statement to CNN Business that open and honest discussion "has always been a part of Facebook\'s culture." "Mark had an open discussion with employees today, as he has regularly over the years," Stone said. "He\'s grateful for their feedback." The meeting has threatened to ratchet up tensions at Facebook, which has been hit with allegations of right-wing bias from conservatives and criticized by others for tacitly condoning the spread of hate and racism. Another Facebook employee told CNN Business they found Zuckerberg\'s answers to staff questions at the town hall lacking, and said the CEO risked alienating more of his staff rather than addressing their concerns. During the event, Facebook staff shared links to a video of an exchange between Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Zuckerberg last October when he said: "If anyone, including a politician, is saying things that can cause, that is calling for violence or could risk imminent physical harm ... we will take that content down." At one point, roughly 22,000 people had tuned into the live video feed, according to another Facebook worker who was watching the stream. The figure reflects nearly half of the company\'s 48,000 employees. The top question for Zuckerberg, which called for changes to the company\'s stance on political speech, received more than 5,400 votes from workers, the employee said. Not all employees disagree with Zuckerberg\'s position, however. One told CNN Business, "Supporting free speech - especially when you vehemently disagree with what the person is saying - is a hard but important stance needed to make sure everyone can have a voice." The employee said it is hard to be sure what portion of Facebook\'s staff supports Zuckerberg\'s decision. At least a few people with whom they have spoken do support it but are nervous to say so more publicly because they have seen the pushback within the company, the employee said. Tuesday\'s event follows days of employee activism over Facebook\'s handling of Trump\'s content. Some staffers staged a virtual walkout on Monday to protest decisions made by the company\'s leaders concerning posts by Trump. And at least one worker, software engineer Timothy Aveni, has quit his job, saying it is no longer feasible to "keep excusing Facebook\'s behavior." Facebook\'s workforce is known for keeping its disputes with executives largely private. But that changed on Friday, when Zuckerberg announced he would not act against content by Trump that Twitter had flagged earlier as having violated its own rules. The decision has prompted widespread criticism within Facebook that has spilled into public, with numerous employees expressing their disagreement on Twitter. One of Trump\'s posts had claimed, in reference to the demonstrations in Minneapolis, that "when the looting starts, the shooting starts" — a phrase with racist origins. Trump later professed not to know the history of the phrase, but he allowed the original remark to stand on Facebook and Twitter. Zuckerberg said the content provoked in him a "visceral negative reaction." But he justified his decision not to act against the posts, citing his responsibility as the "leader of an institution committed to free expression." In the eyes of his harshest internal critics, Zuckerberg had simply caved on prior principled commitments. "Mark can patch this one section of Facebook\'s policies, but if he derives his principle from the particular actions he wants to take, instead of taking action based on principle, it\'ll be fruitless in the long run," Aveni said in response to a CNN reporter\'s question on his post.'),

In addition to rubber bullets — which often have a metal core — police have used tear gas, flash-bang grenades, pepper spray gas and projectiles to control crowds of demonstrators demanding justice for 46-year-old George Floyd, who died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck, while other officers restrained his body. \n George Floyd protests spread nationwide George Floyd protests spread nationwide Some peaceful demonstrations have turned violent, with people smashing windows, setting buildings afire and looting stores. The use by police of rubber bullets has provoked outrage, as graphic images have flashed on social media showing people who have lost an eye or suffered other injuries after being hit. A study published in 2017 in the BMJ found that 3% of people hit by rubber bullets died of the injury. Fifteen percent of the 1,984 people studied were permanently injured by the rubber bullets, also known as "kinetic impact projectiles." Rubber bullets should be used only to control "an extremely dangerous crowd," said Brian Higgins, the former police chief of Bergen County, New Jersey.

In Washington, D.C., the National Guard allegedly fired rubber bullets Monday to disperse peaceful protesters near a historic church where President Donald Trump was subsequently photographed. In a statement, Attorney General William Barr defended the actions of local and federal law enforcement officers in Washington, saying they had "made significant progress in restoring order to the nation\'s capital." Barr did not mention the use of tear gas or rubber bullets. Freelance photographer Linda Tirado said she was blinded by a rubber bullet at a protest in Minneapolis.

The site says the projectiles are "an excellent solution whether you need to incapacitate a single subject or control a crowd." No one knows how often police use rubber bullets, or how many people are harmed every year, said Dr. Rohini Haar, a lecturer at the University of California-Berkeley School of Public Health and medical expert with Physicians for Human Rights. Many victims don\'t go to the hospital. Police are not required to document their use of rubber bullets, so there is no national data to show how often they\'re used, said Higgins, now an adjunct professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. There are no nationally agreed-upon standards for their use. How to talk to your children about protests and racism   How to talk to your children about protests and racism. When aimed at the legs, rubber bullets can stop a dangerous person or crowd from getting closer to a police officer, Lazzaro said. But when fired at close range, rubber bullets can penetrate the skin, break bones, fracture the skull and explode the eyeball, he said. Rubber bullets can cause traumatic brain injuries and "serious abdominal injury, including injuries to the spleen and bowel along with major blood vessels," said Dr. Robert Glatter, an emergency physician in New York City and a spokesperson for the American College of Emergency Physicians. Firing rubber bullets from a distance decreases both their force and their accuracy, increasing the risk of shooting people in the face or hitting bystanders, Lazzaro said.'),

But few are considering uprooting their operations in the Asian financial hub just yet. More than 80% of firms that responded to a survey conducted by the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong said they were either "very" or "moderately" concerned about the law, which is due to ban sedition, secession and subversion against Beijing. The organization said 180 of its members responded to the survey conducted Monday and Tuesday. That\'s about 15% of its membership, which is mostly made up of American companies.

But for western companies, it\'s complicated There is still considerable uncertainty over the law, with even Hong Kong officials admitting they don\'t know exactly what it will cover. They have claimed that it will only affect a tiny number of people, but critics point to the way similarly broad national security legislation is used to crack down upon a wide swath of political activity in mainland China, where numerous prominent activists have been jailed on "subversion" charges. AmCham said many respondents said they understood the need for the law, which comes in the wake of six months of often violent anti-government unrest last year. But some expressed fears that it could lead to "potential harassment and privacy concerns," or that more restrictive measures could be on the way. "I am also worried the tax structure and changes to the [Hong Kong] tax system may occur," wrote one respondent. More than half the firms surveyed also said they were concerned about the law\'s ambiguity and the erosion of Hong Kong\'s autonomy. The former British colony became a semi-autonomous region of China more than 20 years ago, and has largely been left to manage its own affairs since then. The potential that the law could lead to a loss of talent in the city or jeopardize its status as an international business center were also cited as top concerns. American companies also fear that an escalation in US-China relations could hamper cross-border deals. Even so, 70% of respondents said they had no plans to move their business out of Hong Kong. Most also said they would personally not consider leaving. "Not yet, but certainly putting \'insurance\' plans in place and alternative jurisdictions," wrote one respondent. Business and investor confidence in Hong Kong was shaken late last month after news of the forthcoming law broke. The benchmark Hang Seng Index (HSI) sank more than 5% on May 22, its worst one-day percentage drop since July 2015. Since then, though, sentiment has stabilized — and the Hang Seng has even been ticking up as investors shrug off Washington\'s limited response to Beijing\'s new law so far. The index is up nearly 6% this week.  US President Donald Trump last week blasted the national security law and said the country intends to end its special economic and trading relationship with Hong Kong. But experts have pointed out that Trump stopped short of taking immediate action. And they suspect ending the special status won\'t have a big impact immediately because the territory does not export a lot of goods to the United States. More than 70% of the respondents to AmCham\'s survey said they are taking a "wait and see" approach to Trump\'s reaction. "It is far too early to make strategic decisions on the revocation of special trade status," wrote one respondent, who added that it would take many months to implement. Others said that they would consider setting up entities in other parts of the region, including in Singapore. Some 15% of survey respondents said that they were still optimistic about business prospects in Hong Kong, with one calling it an "unparalleled location in Asia Pacific." But nearly half of the respondents said they were pessimistic about business prospects in Hong Kong in the medium-to-long term. One respondent wrote that they were "fearful that the luster will be lost forever." "Being a major city in the second biggest economy is not a minor role but far less than a leading global city," the respondent wrote.')
